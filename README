My first attempt @ capturing a twitter stream on the IOS platform.
Example follows Randal Schwartz' twitter timeline (my Perl hero!).
Enhancements would include:
Segue to 2nd screen to view Tweet details.
Caching of tweets for offline mode.
Enhanced interaction with twitter api for tweeting, retweeting, marking favorites.
